# 2D Game Engine Using Qt Framework

This project is a modular and object-oriented 2D game engine designed using the Qt framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Dynamic Graphics Rendering**:
  - Built with `QGraphicsScene` and `QGraphicsView` for a scalable and efficient rendering pipeline.
  - Customizable tile-based maps using a 2D character array.

- **Interactive Player and NPCs**:
  - Controllable player character, with seamless integration into the game world.
  - NPCs (e.g., Enemy, Frog) demonstrate AI extensibility and interaction design.

- **High-Performance Game Loop**:
  - Smooth updates using `QTimer` with a 16ms interval for 60 FPS gameplay.
  - Modular `gameUpdate()` logic for scene-wide refreshes.

- **Extensible Design**:
  - Modular components for scene management, player, and NPCs.
  - Clearly defined class responsibilities ensure maintainability and scalability.

### Additional Features
- **Physics Integration:** Support for collision detection and basic physics.
- **Audio:** Expandable audio playback capabilities.
